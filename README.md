# SvelteKit Todo

Welcome to my personal project, SvelteKit Todo! This repository serves as an online log of my exploration and learning journey in full-stack development. The project focuses on utilizing SvelteKit, Supabase, and various important concepts to build an interactive todo application.

## Description

The SvelteKit Todo project aims to achieve the following:

1. **Building interactive todo functionality**: Through SvelteKit, I will create a custom accordion-style todo component that enables me to manage tasks efficiently. This includes features like adding new todos, marking them as complete, editing details, and removing them.

2. **Learning SvelteKit forms and actions**: I will dive into SvelteKit's form handling capabilities to understand concepts such as data binding, validation, and submission handling. This knowledge will be crucial for creating dynamic and interactive forms within my application.

3. **Implementing Supabase authentication**: To explore user management, I will integrate Supabase authentication into the project. This will allow me to create user accounts, handle sessions, and ensure secure authentication flows to protect sensitive user data.

4. **Utilizing Supabase database**: I will leverage the Supabase database to efficiently manage data in my todo application. This involves tasks such as creating tables, performing CRUD operations, querying data, and managing relationships between tables.

5. **Enhancing the user experience with Svelte transitions**: I will explore Svelte transitions to add visual effects, smooth animations, and transitions, making the application more engaging and polished. This will contribute to an enjoyable user experience.

Through this SvelteKit Todo project, I aim to elevate my skills in full-stack development, gain hands-on experience with the SvelteKit framework, understand database management with Supabase, and improve the overall user experience. Feel free to follow along with my progress and connect with me if you have any questions or suggestions.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
